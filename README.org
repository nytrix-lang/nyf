* Recursive Formatter

This project tries to formalize the Nytryx programming language

#+begin_src sh
stack build
stack install
#+end_src

Add to the path since stack installs here

#+begin_src sh
# STACK
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
#+end_src

Now you can use it anywhere in the system!

#+begin_src sh
nyf help
#+end_src


* TODO FLAGS [0/1]
- [ ] diff -- It will show the diff of the project since last push
      the diff will be very powerfule because it will also work on
      2 files =nyf file1 file2= like this it will tell if they truly
      change also on a semantic level with trough analysis
- [ ] msg -- Will permit some sort of comunicatio between operators
      of the current project in path, view it as a language builting
      issue tracker system with comments doing theyr things... dw about it
      both the flag name and the system still have to be designed.

* TODO Formal grammar language generator [0/2]
- [ ] EBNF file Generation
- [ ] PEG  file Generation

* TODO Potential new syntax [2/3]

** TODO wrap [FlAG] to generates a .ny file from an .h file
   we SHOULD cache wrappers ahead of time, this allow something like this to work:
   #+begin_src nytrix
   use raylib.h

   BeginDrawing()
   ClearBackground(0xFF181818)
   EndDrawing()

   #+end_src

** DONE Hashmap

@Laluxx
We should support both syntaxes, The first is cleaner IMO.
But the second should also be supported and the default.

   #+begin_src nytrix
   define Hashmap = { meow: 1
                      ciao: 2
                      ciao: 3
                      define: 4 }
;;                     ^
;;                     |
;;  Both the Compiler and Syntax-highlighter should be smart here.
   #+end_src

   #+begin_src nytrix
   define Hashmap = { "meow": 1
                      "ciao": 2
                      "ciao": 3
                      "define": 4 }
   #+end_src

** DONE Switch Case
   CLOSED: [2026-01-13 Tue 23:20]

 This new syntax [[file:~/xos/projects/c/nytrix/src/std/core/reflect.ny::fn len(x) {][Could be used here instead]] it reoves the noise and leave
 a clear mapping between memory and consequence.

   #+begin_src nytrix
   define x = 3; Global variable

   match tag {
       0x4c495354
       0x44494354
       if (x > 3); <- Guard (Do it later)
       0x5345545f
       0x5455504c -> load64(x + 8)
       0x44494354
       0x5345545f
       0x5455504c -> load64(x + 8)
       otherwise
         -> runsomething()
   }
   #+end_src



* TODO Modules [0/1]
- [ ] Modules must be [[https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/functor][functors]]. Exactly like the [[https://ocaml.org/manual/5.4/moduleexamples.html][Ocaml module system]]
